Kotlin is all the rage in the Android community, and for a good reason: the language has made
Android development fun and engaging again. Kotlin's feature set is tasteful and bloat free, aimed
at simplifying everyday tasks without overwhelming developers with every possible edge case.

Does that description remind you of anything? ðŸ˜‰  The Firebase platform has taken a similar stance,
but sometimes to its detriment. For example, Cloud Functions only supports the Node.js runtime (with
Python possibly coming soon). However, if JavaScript isn't your cup of tea, I've got some good news
for you: Kotlin can be used for Firebase Cloud Functions!

## But why stray from theÂ pack?

If you're reading this article, you probably love Kotlinâ€¦ isn't that enough? No? Fine. But first,
let's address the elephant in the room.

### What about TypeScript?

Firebase actually
[recommends](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2018/01/why-you-should-use-typescript-for.html) using
TypeScript over JS for its compile-time safety and linter. But who am I kidding? Static language
users have known this for eons.

Where Kotlin really shines is in its stdlib, which provides excellent support for manipulating data.
Helper functions for collections, sequences, comparisons, etc. are all especially useful on a server
environment where you'll primarily be manipulating data. We're only scratching the surface though,
Coroutines take excellence a level higher.
